    <ul>
    <li>Background: I was born in Chicago but raised in Metro-Detroit. Growing up, I attended Grosse Pointe Public Schools, graduating from Grosse Pointe South in 2011.
    While attending Grosse Pointe South I played on the varsity soccer team and junior varsity lacrosse team.  Upon graduation, I attended the University of Vermont
    from 2011 to 2015, eventually earning a double-major in political science and economics.  After college, I moved back to Grosse Pointe where I worked at Quicken Loans,
    and then moved on to a kitchen job at an Italian restaurant called Mama Rosa's".  Nowadays, I'm learning to program in Java at Grand Circus Code Academy hoping to
    someday enter the tech industry as a developer or engineer.

    <li>Interests/Hobbies: Throughout my life I've bounced between hobbies at varying degrees of involvement.  As an adolescent, sports were my main form of hobby.
    While I played soccer and lacrosse through high school, I also enjoyed playing hockey.  I could often be found practicing my skills in each sport in the driveway,
    on an ice rink, or wherever possible.  In high school and beyond, I often found solace in video games.  Some titles I previously enjoyed include the Halo series and
    the Call of Duty series among others.  Nowadays, I enjoy watching DOTA2 and playing World of Warcraft (although I try and maintain an "undercover nerd" persona).
    Collecting vinyl records (and playing them of course!) is also a big hobby of mine as well as watching Jeopardy!.</li>

    <li>Looking Forward: Looking forward, I want to find a career that not only piques my own interest but allows me to return to the community, in some way, my skills.  Hopefully
    that path can be found through programming.  Having always been the one in the family staring at his computer for whatever reasons, I thought it would be a good
    opportunity to attend the Grand Circus Java bootcamp as a way to move in that direction and transition out of the resturant industry.  My hopes are to find a reliable job;
    one where I can eventually support myself as well as any family that might be part of my life in the future.  Here's to hoping.</li>
