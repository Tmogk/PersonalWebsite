    <br>Interests/Hobbies: Throughout my life I've bounced between hobbies at varying degrees of involvement.  As an adolescent, sports were my main form of hobby.
    While I played soccer and lacrosse through high school, I also enjoyed playing hockey.  I could often be found practicing my skills in each sport in the driveway,
    on an ice rink, or wherever possible.  In high school and beyond, I often found solace in video games.  Some titles I previously enjoyed include the Halo series and
    the Call of Duty series among others.  Nowadays, I enjoy watching DOTA2 and playing World of Warcraft (although I try and maintain an "undercover nerd" persona).
    Collecting vinyl records (and playing them of course!) is also a big hobby of mine as well as watching Jeopardy!.
